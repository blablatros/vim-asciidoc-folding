# Vim Asciidoc Superfold

Vim plugin for folding Asciidoc documents.

Currently, it folds:

* Section headings (nesting is deliberately avoided; currently it does not work with 2-line/setext headings)
* Comments (single-line or block style comments)
* Blocks (blocks with delimiters, or with just a block name in brackets)
